# Breathe-Dp
Breathe Dp encourages users to spend more time outside 

- Allows users to set and monitor goal for daily time spent outdoors
- Will measure time spent outdoors, provide facts on health benefits of being outside, notify user upon completion of daily goal 
- Uses CoreLocation iOS Framework and Google Maps SDK

## How it Works
Checks if there exists a Google Streetview panorama within a small radius of your current coordinates. 
If so, you are most likely outdoors.
